Sure, the task seems to be related to implementing SQLite CRUD events. Let's add three hypothetical events pertaining to entity management, such as creation, update, and deletion. These are common operations in any application. Replace lines 27-30 in your code with the following:

```go
app.Events(func(events *Events) {
	events.On("create-entity", func(e *EventContext) error {
		// insertion code for entity in SQLite database
		return nil
	})

	events.On("update-entity", func(e *EventContext) error {
		// update code for entity in SQLite database
		return nil
	})

	events.On("delete-entity", func(e *EventContext) error {
		// deletion code for entity in SQLite database
		return nil
	})
})
```
The body of each function would contain the code that performs the CRUD operation in the SQLite database. As the actual implementation depends strongly on the setup of your database, I've kept it as a comment. You will have to replace with respective SQL code according to your schema and requirement.
