## Pb&J Stack

The PB Stacks for _P_ocket_B_ase, and the J stands for _j_ust HTMX.

## Simplicity > Dependencies

I wanted to make the simplest stack I could using the least number of dependencies, and writing the simplest code. This is a very hard balance to find as simplicity hides complexity.

Independently, I found both PocketBase and HTMX. Both solutions focus on what can be done simply and effectively. Once I looked at the documentation for PocketBase and saw that with Go I can render templates the path forward was clear.
